 * per active webhook for the form. Dispatch is asynchronous: the
 * submission handler returns immediately, the user lands on the
 * success page, and the dispatcher picks the queue up either on the
 * next every-minute tick or via the single-event "right now" hook
 * we schedule alongside the enqueue.
 *
 * Conditional delivery + field mapping (Phase 6d) plug in here too —
 * for now this just gates on `is_active` and enqueues unconditionally.
