 * Two cron triggers feed the hook:
 *
 *   1. Every-minute recurring schedule (registered in Plugin::init).
 *      Catches retry rows whose `next_retry_at` has passed.
 *   2. Single-event "right after this submission" scheduled by
 *      `SubmissionListener` so new deliveries dispatch within
 *      seconds, not minutes.
